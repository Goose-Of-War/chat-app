 A chat app using Node.js

### The useless introduction from moi which nobody cares about. To skip, [click here](https://github.com/Goose-Of-War/chat-app/blob/main/README.md#stuff-i-have-on-me)
Hello y'all (who's y'all now? :( ) As you can see, I am not dead. Well, I'm technically undead but let's leave that for later. 

_It's been so long since I did this that I am starting to forget what I used to do in this. Let me just check some of my old repositories. Aha. Back on track now._ 

The good old backstory for why I am doing this. So... now that I have been working on the [MASK repository](https://github.com/mask-tech/MASK) for a while now, I was thinking of doing something in node so as to get a proper idea of how to work on a node app without the base work already done for me (and believe me, this feels completely different from making ends meet on the MASK repo)

### Stuff I have on me
> _For those who skipped my intro and directly came here, congrats. You made me sad ;-;_

The chat app works on node, using the following modules:
- `axios`: to send POST requests (I don't like the form)
- `express`: for the app in itself
= `mongoose`: to store and use the data
- `cookie-parser`: for storing the username
- `socket.io`: for the message service (working on it in the new branch)
- `nunjucks`: for the templates (when I finally get to front-end ;-;)

### Current progress (and 

Well, mongoose works, so yay for that. I got sign-in and sign-up working on me. So that's fine ig. It is with great pleasure that I announce that I finally have cookies and that the messages sent are being stored. With that being said, I still need to add the socket integrations.
In terms of front-end, we have no front-end (if you actually read that in the Gru voice, you are definitely a man of culture.) I'll probably work on it in the very end (or if anyone wants to fork this, you're welcome to. I'll probably treat you to a cup of coffee or some maggi or something)

_Until then, Honk_
